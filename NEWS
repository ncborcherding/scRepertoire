CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.2
------------------------

* added dot.size parameter to scatterClonotype
* filteringMulti now subsets clonotypes with contains >=2, to prevent 2 of the same chains


CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.2
------------------------

# Working on renumbering versions for consistency - this is the new current dev branch
# The below have not been implemented into the master branch or the bioconductor version

* added the combineTRUST4 function to parse contigs from TUST4 pipeline
* added the filter of contigs by chain in the combineTCR, combineBCR, and combineTRUST4 functions
* no longer require the ID in the combineTCR/BCR/TRUST4 functions
* added jaccard index for overlap analysis
* replaced vizVgene with vizGene - allowing users to look at any gene in the combinedContig object
* Fixed coloring scale on the overlap analysis
* Added regressClonotype function using harmony to remove the clonotype effect on feature space
* allowed occupiedRepertoire to use proportion.
* added scatterClonotype function to Viz.R

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.2.1
------------------------

* number of changes to the parseTCR/BCR functions to limit assumptions
* Changed grabMeta to include assessment of colnames
* fixed lengthDF handling of single chains with multi chains stored - ;
* Added labels to alluvialClonotype and occupiedClonotype plotting

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.1.4
------------------------

* replaced hammingCompare with lvCompare to enable superior clonotype calling in combineBCR function.
* added proportion to combineExpression() function so users no longer need to know absolute frequencies when combining the contiguous information. 
* added clusterTCR() and clonalOverlay() functions.
* added downsampling to the diversity calculations
* replaced hammingCompare with lvCompare to enable superior clonotype calling in combineBCR function.
* added proportion to combineExpression() function so users no longer need to know absolute frequencies when combining the contiguous information. 
* added clusterTCR() and clonalOverlay() functions.
* added downsampling to the diversity calculations
* Clonal Overlap Coefficient issue fixed, was comparing unique barcodes and not clonotypes
* Added function checkBlanks to remove list elements without clonotypes, this prevents errors for visualizations
* Re-added Startrac metrics by stripping down the package and adding it piecemeal
* Heavily modified dependencies to reduce total number 

CHANGES IN VERSION 1.0.0
------------------------

* removed dependencies ggfittext and ggdendrogram
* clonesizeDistribution now returns a plot() function

------------------------

* Added getCirclize() 


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.15
------------------------

* Modified numerator for index function


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.14
------------------------

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.11
------------------------

* Updated compareClonotype to allow for clonotype comparisons


CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.10
------------------------

* Bioconductor did not detect the version update.

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.9
------------------------

CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.8
------------------------

* Passed checks on system, let's see how much bioconductor hates it
